# Typewriter Mode for Obsidian

Typewriter Mode is a plugin that adds typewriter scrolling (current line stays at a fixed position on the screen), a highlight for the current line, dimming of unfocused paragraphs and more to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
All features can be turned on or off individually and have a variety of settings to customize their behavior to your liking.
Below you can find a list of all features and settings.

_These are a few exemplary screen captures:_

## Derived from

This plugin started as a fork of the incredible [Typewriter Scroll](https://github.com/deathau/cm-typewriter-scroll-obsidian) plugin by [deathau](https://github.com/deathau). It was turned into a separate plugin because many new features were added, breaking changes were introduced, and the code was completely restructured to make it more extensible.

## Development

The repo depends on the latest [Obsidian Plugin API](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api).

If you want to contribute to this project or make your own changes, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`, `yarn` or `pnpm i`
3. Build with `npm run build`, `yarn build` or `pnpm build`
4. Copy `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `styles.css` to a subfolder of your plugins folder (e.g, `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-name>/`)
5. Reload obsidian to see changes

If you clone this repo into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-name>/` you do not need to copy the files manually and can skip step 4.
