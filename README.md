Typewriter Mode is a plugin that adds typewriter scrolling (current line stays at a fixed position on the screen), a highlight for the current line, dimming of unfocused paragraphs and more to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
All features can be turned on or off individually and have various settings to customize their behavior to your liking.

_These are a few exemplary screen captures:_

## Acknowledgements

This plugin started as a fork of the incredible [Typewriter Scroll](https://github.com/deathau/cm-typewriter-scroll-obsidian) plugin by [deathau](https://github.com/deathau). It was turned into a separate plugin because many new features were added, breaking changes were introduced, and the code was completely restructured to make it more extensible.

The sentence highlighting was derived from [Focus Active Sentence](https://github.com/artisticat1/focus-active-sentence) by [artisticat1](https://github.com/artisticat1).

The writing focus was derived from [Obsidian Focus Mode](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode) by [ryanpcmcquen](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen).

Many thanks to the developers of these awesome plugins.
