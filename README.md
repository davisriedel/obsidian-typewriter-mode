Typewriter Mode is plugin that adds several features to turn [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) into a typewriter-like, distraction-free writing environment, including:

- Typewriter scrolling (current line stays at a fixed position on the screen)
- Highlighting the current line
- Keeping a set number of lines above and below the cursor
- Dimming unfocused paragraphs / sentences
- Fullscreen writing focus
- Limit line length to set number of characters

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with Obsidian v0.15.0 and above. It does not support the legacy editor.

## Installation

To install community plugins, make sure _safe mode_ is turned off in Obsidian's settings.

### Obsidian

You can install this plugin within Obsidian by doing the following:

- Go to Settings > Community Plugins > Browse
- Search for “Typewriter Mode”
- Click Install
- Click Enable

### Manual

1. Download the latest release from GitHub: [https://github.com/davisriedel/obsidian-typewriter-mode/releases](https://github.com/davisriedel/obsidian-typewriter-mode/releases)
2. Extract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`. _Note: On some machines, the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On macOS, you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder._

### Beta Versions With BRAT

Follow the instructions in the repository of the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat#Quick-Guide-for-using-BRAT) and use this repository's URL: `https://github.com/davisriedel/obsidian-typewriter-mode` to install **beta versions** of the plugin.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin started as a fork of the incredible [Typewriter Scroll](https://github.com/deathau/cm-typewriter-scroll-obsidian) plugin by [deathau](https://github.com/deathau). It was turned into a separate plugin because many new features were added, breaking changes were introduced, and the code was completely restructured to make it more extensible.

The sentence highlighting was derived from [Focus Active Sentence](https://github.com/artisticat1/focus-active-sentence) by [artisticat1](https://github.com/artisticat1).

The writing focus was derived from [Obsidian Focus Mode](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen/obsidian-focus-mode) by [ryanpcmcquen](https://github.com/ryanpcmcquen).

Many thanks to the developers of these fantastic plugins.
